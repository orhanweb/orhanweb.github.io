      We are currently in a live inception. I don't even need to explain this project ðŸ˜„. But let's give a quick summary anyway.
      This project was developed with modern web technologies and serves as both a display and a testbed.
      Built with React and TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS, and enhanced with smooth animations via Framer Motion.
      It also utilizes React Icons for iconography and React Scroll for smooth in-page navigation.
      Powered by Vite, the development experience is fast, and the performance is top-notch.

    title: 'Inventory Counting System',
    description: `
      This application was developed for a former employer as a comprehensive inventory management solution.
      Designed to facilitate accurate stock counts within warehouses, stores, or any organizational structure,
      it allows users to create and manage individual stock counts, quickly adding items via barcode scanning.
      Each stock count operates independently, enabling precise tracking, and can be exported to Excel for reporting purposes.
      The application is fully responsive and features modern, intuitive components. Global state management is handled with Redux,
      and RTK Query is employed for efficient RESTful API interactions. The app also supports both light and dark themes,
      and careful attention was given to clean code practices and organized file management.
      React Router is used for seamless route handling throughout the application.

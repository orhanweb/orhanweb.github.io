  `Hi thereðŸ‘‹ I'm Orhan, born in 2000 in BalÄ±kesir, where I still reside. During my Computer Engineering studies,
   I worked on various school projects in different programming languages and fields. One of these projects involved
   developing a mobile application using Flutter. After discovering Flutter, I spent about two years working on
   various projects during university to improve my skills.`,

  `After graduating from university in 2023, I worked at Ã‡iloÄŸlu Handels GmbH for 1.5 years, actively contributing to ERP
   system development projects using React and TypeScript. In this role, I developed user-friendly solutions that
   optimized business processes by leveraging modern frontend technologies. The contributions I made to the technology
   infrastructure and my performance-focused approach played a key role in the success of these projects.`,

   focusing on becoming a MERN stack developer, working specifically on Express.js, and aiming to expand my knowledge
   in all areas of technology ðŸš€`,
